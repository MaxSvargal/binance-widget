# Greetings!
My name is Maksim and I am a JavaScript full-stack engineer.

I can offer 10 years of professional experience in front-end development and full-stack engineering. I am highly competent in TypeScript ecosystem for both front-end and back-end applications. This includes clients for web and as well as multithreading servers with NodeJS. I have an experience with server-side software like SQL and NoSQL databases, IndexedDB, streams with Kafka, caches like Redis, containerization with Docker and Kubernates. As well as that, I have had extensive experience in web design and in UI/UX development and advanced skills in Adobe Suite. So, I find it useful in designers teamwork. Of course I can write excellent adaptive CSS using the latest features like grid, flex, complex animations and more.
I have to mention that I have successfully completed several on-line projects that you can find listed in my Resume. Most of them have been released gradually and quickly, and were as well supported for 3 years and more.

My experience and expectations:
- Fully remote work with the best people from the whole world
- Agile environment but with long planning
- Modeling or prototyping to make a base to produce the final software
- TDD and BDD with QA
- Code reviews to get meaningful and correct solutions
- The most accurate time estimates for issues and epics

Success being for me a team affair to which everyone must contribution, I encourage the motivation by creating the conditions that allow this alchemy to take place.
Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity where I can put my abilities to work for a mission!

# Work with Binance
I remember your company from it's birth day and I belive in it instantly.
I looked on your user interfaces and they are really beatiful and works well, so I already have had expirience to realize that in  competent and professional point of view.

So, I working with cryptocurrencies since 2016 then I have had a lot of practice with automation in crypto trading. First versions of cource, was awful. So, I created a lot of experiments and well working prototypes based on technical analysis. But sometimes I couldn't control that chaos and trade bots were losing. I worked with Bitfinex API first and Binance API later. Once apon a time I switched to because it was faster, stable and cheaper!

At the same time I worked in Ducatur crypto startup from Moscow. We developed Multichain Oracles Framework and Cold Crypto Wallet based on WebRTC and QR reader for offline using.

Sometimes I coming back to my crypto ideas. At last time I got to know Linear algebra -> Machine learning -> RNN/LSTM Modeling with Tensorflow.
So, I just try to predicate a price for a few time steps and I already have some progress. I extract weights and results from the "white noise".

I would love to work with you as a front-end engineer because I am good at it and I have a lot of experience, so for sure I will do great things!

# Test hints
When I reading the test overview, I realized "widget" that something lightweight, so React hooks is all that I need for now. But in production, I prefer to use solid state managers like `mobx-state-tree` or `mobx-keystone`, so using one of them makes many things much easier. And style-componenta or emotion or other css-in-js libraries can help a lot if work in TypeScript environment.
I didn't use unit tests here because the components wouldn't be shared. As with best practice,  integration testing on the front-end is the preferred.
